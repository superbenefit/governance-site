## About This Documentation

This site serves as the central hub for SuperBenefit DAO's governance documentation. Content is maintained in our [governance repository](https://github.com/superbenefit/governance) and dynamically loaded to ensure you always have access to the most current information.

### Key Principles

- **Transparency**: All governance documents are publicly accessible and version-controlled
- **Participation**: Community members can propose changes and improvements through standard processes
- **Minimum Viable Coordination**: Our framework provides essential structure while enabling flexibility and adaptation
- **Living Documents**: Governance evolves through community consensus and documented proposals
